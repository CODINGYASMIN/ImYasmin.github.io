                    <p>During my UPSR days, I wasn’t a shining star in academics..I managed only 1A. It was a tough pill to swallow, knowing my results might be compared to others by family. But despite the struggles, that 1A was a victory I fought hard for. Subjects like Malay felt like mountains I could never climb, yet I persevered. What kept me going? This neighbor of mine, a true pillar of support. They never gave up on me, guiding me patiently through my weaknesses. Even now, as an adult, they remain one of my greatest cheerleaders, a reminder that true success lies in the strength of those who lift us up.</p> 

<p>At the time, it felt as though my parents didn’t fully acknowledge the efforts I put in during my primary school years. It hurt, especially as a child yearning for recognition. However, with maturity, I now understand their intentions weren’t to diminish my achievements but to push me toward becoming a stronger, more resilient individual. Their actions, though tough, were rooted in love and a desire to see me rise above challenges.</p>

<p>As the eldest, the weight of setting a flawless example for my younger sibling has often felt overwhelming. The pressure to be a role model, to pave the way, is not without its struggles. Yet, I hold firmly to the belief that effort never betrays the outcome. Though the journey is demanding, I trust that brighter days await—days where the fruits of perseverance will flourish and bring blessings far greater than I can imagine.</p>

                    <p>Once again, I was down because I only got 1A results. 1A 5B 2C 1D, not very outstanding but for me it was good enough even though the subject I was very weak in (mathematics) got D. Through the picture above, you can see that I have many friends who are very supportive. Even though my results are not as excellent as theirs, they gave me a lot of advice to always be grateful because there are others who cannot achieve like me. PT3 gave me a new change in myself because it was the first time I experienced a big exam at the secondary school level. I put a new resolution in life to study hard again and with the intention of Allah SWT</p>

               <p>At this point in my journey, I can confidently say that I have invested my utmost effort, for this exam will ultimately determine my future and my ability to continue my studies at university. Throughout this experience, I have encountered both bitter and sweet moments, each shaping my perspective in profound ways. One of the most significant challenges I faced was the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which marked the beginning of the 2004 batch's struggle to adapt. As schools closed, we were forced to study from home, disrupting the traditional face-to-face learning environment. For two long years, we navigated the complexities of online education, and even the SPM trial exams were held virtually.</p>

My motivation often fluctuated during this time. There were moments when I felt overwhelmed and disheartened, questioning whether I should continue. The emotional toll of constantly fighting fatigue and frustration almost led me to give up. Yet, as the date of the SPM exam drew nearer, I felt a shift within me. Allah, in His infinite wisdom, touched my heart, reminding me of the importance of perseverance. I was guided to regain my focus, to abandon my laziness, and to renew my commitment to prayer. This strengthened my resolve and helped me regain my sense of purpose.</p>

When the results finally came in, I was overjoyed to find that my hard work had paid off. I had achieved a remarkable result of 7A's, and in that moment, I felt a deep sense of pride and accomplishment. My goal had been reached, and I knew that every moment of struggle had been worth it. To keep myself motivated during my preparation, I wrote my goals on the whiteboard at home as a constant reminder of what I was working towards.</p>

The road was not without its obstacles, but I came to understand that every challenge has a solution. One of the most valuable lessons I learned was the importance of collaboration and sharing knowledge. I made it a habit to study with my friends, as we exchanged insights and helped each other. This not only reinforced my understanding but also made the learning process more enjoyable and fulfilling.</p>

In the end, this experience has been one of growth, resilience, and faith. I am proud of what I have achieved, and I am grateful for the lessons it has taught me.</p>

                    <p>In short, I never thought I would study here, have the opportunity to continue my studies at UiTM. The Information Management course was not the first course I chose because I considered taking a nursing course since it was one of my dreams. But my fortune is here, and it is not regretting myself because this course is fun and challenging. In short, this is what I have been and am doing in the Diploma in information management:
<ol type="I">
  <li>Joinned Club Information Management Society(IMS)</li>
  <li>In my final year of diploma (semester 5)</li>
  <li>Wishing to graduate in first class </li>
  <li>Need to make an outreach program for final year project</li>
</ol>That's all for now, more journey to come that i need to face hihi</p>
